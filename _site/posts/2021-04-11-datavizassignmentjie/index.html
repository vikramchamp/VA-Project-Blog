<h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>This assignment is part of the R Shiny App my team is going to build – Enabling optimization of Bike Sharing Operations. This blog will be focusing on module 3 and 4. In the following blog, it will consisted of a literature review, data preparation and how the visualization will be built step by step, and finally the final story board.</p>
<h1 id="literature-review">2. Literature review</h1>
<p>Bike-sharing is often analyzed in data visualization and analytics. The most frequently analyses are focusing on the stations’ demand. Sathishkumar and Cho (2020) did a season-wise bike sharing demand analysis using the random forest to predict the demand for bike. Oliveira et al (2016) did visual analytics of bike-sharing systems and that was focusing on the in-time operational status in maps displaying as they found that maps displaying the operational status kind of visualization are useful for understanding the current status of the stations only. El-Assi et al (2015) were also focusing on the demand for bikes by the station level depending on the environment and weather. Yan et al (2018) were using bike-sharing data to do a visual analytics system to investigate the user’s daily activity patterns based on tensor factorization. There are seldom analyses looking at the bike level, most of the current studies are focusing on the station level. As mentioned by Dai et al (2020) that the visualization in the map only provides basic geographic information, user might be confused if they’re not familiar with the study region. There is a lack of bike-sharing analyses focus on the bike itself, they are not looking at the individual bike utilization and bike usage on the bike level. This could help to identify if there is the issue of overused bikes lacking maintenance or servicing at the right time intervals. Analysing the bike usage could help in determining the right time to perform servicing and maintenance on the bike usage.</p>

<h2 id="distribution-of-the-bike-trips-by-weekday">Distribution of the bike trips by weekday</h2>
<p>This is to analyze the bike trips distribution by week of day. Violin plots allow to visualize the distribution of a numeric variable for one or several groups. They are very well adapted for large dataset. We will be using the plotly to plot violin plot by having the week of day as x-axis and number of trips as the y-axis, split by the week of day as color to differentiate. In addition, a boxplot could summarizes the distribution of the number of trips by week of day. As in boxplot it only has the median, thus a mean value is added to show the average. Lastly, add a title, x-axis, y-axis labels to the violin plot.</p>

<h2 id="anyalyze-each-bikes-utilization">Anyalyze each bike’s utilization</h2>
<p>We define the utilization as the frequency of the bike used in a day. This is to display each bike’s utilization by the histogram throughout the month. We have further added the user type as fill to know out of the total number of trips, to get an general idea of the distribution of the bike used by customer or subscriber.</p>
<p>The prototype below is using bike id “4770” as an example, when it come to the application, we will allow user to select the bikeid from the user interface to look at the individual level of the bike.</p>
<p>First pass a value and subset the data. In the actual App, the value will be passed via selector on UI. Secondly, plot the histogram using ggplot, use day of the month as the x-axis and fill with user type. Lastly, add a title to the graph.</p>

<h1 id="storyboard">5. Storyboard</h1>
<p>User will first have an overview of the frequency of the bike been used in a month in boxplot for each weekday. And then user could drill down to the individual bike by filtering the bike ID which will be enabled later and have a closer look at the bike uitilization each day in a month.</p>
